# population_projection
I recently developed an population projection curve, which projects the population of three countries - India, China & Japan. 
The variables take into account were birth rates, death rates, occurrences of epidemics, sex ratio, etc. 
I indigenously developed an equation, with the help of past 20 years data, and projected the population growth till the end of this century.
